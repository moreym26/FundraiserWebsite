            <h3>Why should you donate?</h3>
            <p>Donating to Sequim High School is a 
                straightforward process that can make 
                a significant impact on the students 
                and the community. Interested donors can 
                visit the school's official website, where 
                they will find a dedicated donation page 
                with detailed instructions. Contributions 
                can be made online through secure payment 
                methods, or donors can choose to send checks 
                directly to the school's administrative office. 
                Additionally, the school often organizes fundraising 
                events and campaigns, providing various opportunities for 
                community members to contribute. By donating, 
                individuals can support essential programs, facility 
                improvements, and extracurricular activities, 
                helping to create a thriving and enriched educational 
                environment for all students.</p>

            <p>People should consider donating money to 
                    Sequim High School, including its athletics 
                    department, to help address critical issues such 
                    as decaying buildings and lack of funding. These 
                    challenges hinder the ability of students to 
                    learn and participate in sports in a safe and 
                    supportive environment. Donations can provide 
                    much-needed resources to renovate outdated 
                    facilities, purchase new equipment, and support 
                    programs that enrich students' educational and 
                    athletic experiences. By contributing, donors 
                    play a crucial role in ensuring that Sequim High 
                    School continues to offer quality education and 
                    extracurricular activities, ultimately helping 
                    students reach their full potential.</p>
